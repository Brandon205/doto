Doto is available on the web thanks to Github.io! Just go to https://brandon205.github.io/doto/ or click [here](https://brandon205.github.io/doto/).

### Android

Simply go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Brandon205/doto/releases) tab of this github repository and download the latest release .apk file. This should end up in your downloads folder and you can run the APK and it will install onto your device.

### IOS

Currently there isn't a way to get Doto on IOS and there aren't any plans to as of yet just because it is a simple to do list app which there are many other choices for.

## How to use Doto

### Add tasks

On every page (Soon, Later, and Eventually) there is a Plus button in the center at the top underneath the page titles, simply click this, input the details of the task, and hit Add Item. Your task will then be added to the list based on which page you were on.

### Update, Delete, and Complete Tasks

Once a task is created there are 3 buttons underneath the task details, each one of these will Update, Delete, or Complete the task respectively.
